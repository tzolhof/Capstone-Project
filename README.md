Heart Disease

Heart Disease is a global problem that takes lives of millions of people every year. According to the World Health Organization - WHO1, 17.9 million people die every year from cardiovascular diseases, corresponding to 31% of all deaths worldwide. In the United States, data taken from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention â€“ CDC website2 show that about 610,000 people die of heart disease in the country every year, corresponding to 1 in every 4 deaths. Also according to the WHO, triggering these diseases are tobacco smoking, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, and the harmful use of alcohol. These in turn show up in people as raised blood pressure, elevated blood glucose, and overweight/obesity.

Using a dataset of people with several information about their characteristics and health condition, it is necessary to predict the presence of heart disease in them, creating a model that can be used in new data, not contained in the dataset. This would allow to take action to prevent the evolution of the condition, when it is already present, but also maximize the awareness of the problem as a whole, encouraging prevention efforts. 

The repository includes:

* this README file;
* the processed.cleveland.data.txt file, which contains the data that will be used to train the model;
* the proposal.pdf file, with the project proposal details;
* the Requirements.txt, which contains a list of the libraries/packages and environment versions used in the project;
* the report.pdf file, including the Definition, Analysis, Methodology, Results, and Conclusion of the project;
* the Heart_Disease_Capstone.ipynb, with the Python Notebook of the project's implementation;
* the Heart_Disease_Capstone.html, as an html version of the Python Notebook mentioned above.
